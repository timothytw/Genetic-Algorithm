The goal of this repository is to create a simple and generic framework for people who want to use the genetic algorithm in their C++ projects.

This is a non standard implementation based on John H. Holland's work, "Genetic Algorithms" (1992). See https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/515e/f260621c1bf21c5c4f809ee6a04c6f9c8f2e.pdf for details.
